### Pvp Zone

#### Border

Borders extend 500 units above the cube's top side, and allow bullets, but not players, through. They are useful for preventing unwanted player access to odd places, and are extensively used in rotation (pub) maps. Be mindful that 500 units is not infinite and if you have differently-leveled borders, or other structures nearby, players can make their way over the borders. Borders do not rotate with normal object rotation, and complex collision usage will disable the border altogether.

`Toggle switch`
`Default: OFF`

#### Technical & Logic > Destructible

Allows triggers to destroy this object. Disables some optimization, so using too many objects with this property enabled may be detrimental to performance.

`Toggle switch`
`Default: OFF`

#### Technical & Logic > Start Destroyed

Does not spawn the object at the beginning of a game.

`Toggle switch`
`Default: OFF`

#### Technical & Logic > Spawn Chance

Pair with **Destructible** and **Start Destroyed** to give objects a certain chance to spawn. As with other properties, 0% chance is actually 100%.

`Range input (float)`
`Range: 0-100`
`Default: 0`

#### Technical & Logic > Health

Once this amount of damage is incurred, the object will be destroyed. This is useful for interactive barriers and spleef-type maps.

`Range input (float)`
`Range: 0-50000`
`Default: 0`

#### Technical & Logic > Respawn > Timer (s)

After destroyed, will be recreated according to this time.

`Range input (float)`
`Range: 0-3600`
`Default: 0`

#### Technical & Logic > Respawn > Random

Random respawn time, very small range (under 10 seconds, exact range unknown).

`Toggle switch`
`Default: OFF`

#### Technical & Logic > Interface > ID

Interface ID is used to identify dynamic objects and targets for trigger actions.

`Range input (float)`
`Range: 0-2000`
`Default: 0`

#### Position

Location of the object in Cartesian coordinates. Positive Y is in the up direction. X and Z location defines the *center* and the Y location defines the bottom.

`Number input (float)`
`Default: 0, 0, 0`

#### Rotation

Rotation about each Cartesian axis. The Y rotation, for example, allows users to rotate an object laying on the XZ plane (a horizontal surface). Consider 1.3.4 and be mindful of using nonzero rotation with collidable objects.

`Number input (float)`
`Default: 0, 0, 0`

#### Size

Scale of the object.

`Number input (float)`
`Default: 0, 0, 0`
